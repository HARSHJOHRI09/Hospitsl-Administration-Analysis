🛠 Tools Used
MS Excel 2010: Dashboard creation using Pivot Tables, Slicers, and multiple charts.

GitHub: Version control and centralized sharing.

📊 Dashboard Components
Slicers/Filters: Instantly segment data by Gender, Race, Diabetes Medication, and Readmission status, empowering focused analysis.

Readmission by Age Group: (Horizontal Bar) Reveals peak readmissions among elderly patients—especially age groups 70–80 and 80–90—highlighting age as a major risk factor.

Hospital Stay by Specialty: (Vertical Bar) Shows average length of stay for each medical specialty. Endocrinology and Pulmonology emerge as outliers with significantly longer average hospitalizations, pointing to chronic condition burden.

Readmission Rate by Gender and Race: (Stacked Columns) Compares readmission patterns across demographic groups, surfacing care disparities among races.

Diabetes Influence: (Pie Chart) 23.1% of diabetic patients are readmitted within 30 days, underlining the urgent need for diabetes care improvements.

🔍 Key Insights
Age Impact: Elderly patients (ages 70–90) display the highest readmission rates, suggesting targeted intervention is critical.

Specialty Patterns: Longer average hospital stays in specialties like Endocrinology indicate chronic disease complexity as a driver for readmissions.

Emergency History: Increased previous emergency visits are linked to a higher chance of readmission, signaling high-risk patients.

Diabetes Risk: Nearly 1 in 4 diabetic inpatients are readmitted within a month, emphasizing the importance of robust diabetes management programs.

Demographic Differences: Notable variations in readmissions by gender and race reveal potential areas for equity improvement.
